<h1>GeoPandas Project Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#geopandas-project-code-of-conduct" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Behind the GeoPandas Project is an engaged and respectful community made up of
people from all over the world and with a wide range of backgrounds.
Naturally, this implies diversity of ideas and perspectives on often
complex problems. Disagreement and healthy discussion of conflicting
viewpoints is welcome: the best solutions to hard problems rarely come from a single
angle. But disagreement is not an excuse for aggression: humans tend to take
disagreement personally and easily drift into behavior that ultimately
degrades a community. This is particularly acute with online communication
across language and cultural gaps, where many cues of human behavior are
unavailable. We are outlining here a set of principles and processes to support a
healthy community in the face of these challenges.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, we are committed to fostering a productive, harassment-free
environment for everyone. Rather than considering this code an exhaustive list
of things that you can’t do, take it in the spirit it is intended - a guide to
make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate.</p>
<p>Importantly: as a member of our community, <em>you are also a steward of these
values</em>. Not all problems need to be resolved via formal processes, and often
a quick, friendly but clear word on an online forum or in person can help
resolve a misunderstanding and de-escalate things.</p>
<p>However, sometimes these informal processes may be inadequate: they fail to
work, there is urgency or risk to someone, nobody is intervening publicly and
you don’t feel comfortable speaking in public, etc. For these or other
reasons, structured follow-up may be necessary and here we provide the means
for that: we welcome reports by emailing
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:geopandas-conduct&#37;&#52;&#48;googlegroups&#46;com">geopandas-conduct<span>&#64;</span>googlegroups<span>&#46;</span>com</a> or by filling out <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8Tbi2zNl1i2N9COX0yavHEqTGFIPQ1_cLcy1A3JgVc1OrAQ/viewform">this
form</a>.</p>
<p>This code applies equally to founders, developers, mentors and new community
members, in all spaces managed by the GeoPandas Project. This
includes the mailing lists, our GitHub organization, our chat room, in-person
events, and any other forums created by the project team. In addition,
violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person’s ability to
participate within them.</p>
<p>By embracing the following principles, guidelines and actions to follow or
avoid, you will help us make Jupyter a welcoming and productive community. Feel
free to contact the Code of Conduct Committee at
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:geopandas-conduct&#37;&#52;&#48;googlegroups&#46;com">geopandas-conduct<span>&#64;</span>googlegroups<span>&#46;</span>com</a> with any questions.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Be friendly and patient</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be welcoming</strong>. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited
to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color,
immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity and expression, age, physical appearance, family
status, technological or professional choices, academic
discipline, religion, mental ability, and physical ability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be considerate</strong>. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when
making decisions. Remember that we’re a world-wide community. You may be
communicating with someone with a different primary language or cultural
background.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be respectful</strong>. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. We might all experience some
frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people
feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose</strong>. Be kind to others. Do not insult
or put down other community members. Harassment and other exclusionary
behavior are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Violent threats or violent language directed against another person</p></li>
<li><p>Discriminatory jokes and language</p></li>
<li><p>Posting sexually explicit or violent material</p></li>
<li><p>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”)</p></li>
<li><p>Personal insults, especially those using racist, sexist, and xenophobic terms</p></li>
<li><p>Unwelcome sexual attention</p></li>
<li><p>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior</p></li>
<li><p>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Moderate your expectations</strong>. Please respect that community members choose
how they spend their time in the project. A thoughtful question about your
expectations is preferable to demands for another person’s time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When we disagree, try to understand why</strong>. Disagreements, both social and
technical, happen all the time and the GeoPandas Project is no exception. Try to
understand where others are coming from, as seeing a question from their
viewpoint may help find a new path forward. And don’t forget that it is
human to err: blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere, while we can learn
from mistakes to find better solutions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A simple apology can go a long way</strong>. It can often de-escalate a situation,
and telling someone that you are sorry is an act of empathy that doesn’t
automatically imply an admission of guilt.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Reporting<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please report this in
a timely manner. Code of conduct violations reduce the value of the community
for everyone and we take them seriously.</p>
<p>You can file a report by emailing
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:geopandas-conduct&#37;&#52;&#48;googlegroups&#46;com">geopandas-conduct<span>&#64;</span>googlegroups<span>&#46;</span>com</a> or by filing out

<p>The online form gives you the option to keep your report anonymous or request
that we follow up with you directly. While we cannot follow up on an anonymous
report, we will take appropriate action.</p>
<p>Messages sent to the e-mail address or through the form will be sent
only to the Code of Conduct Committee, which currently consists of:</p>
